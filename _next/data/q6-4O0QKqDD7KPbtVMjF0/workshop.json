This year weâ€™re planning a major upgrade to the workshop, which we dub GEM2, through the introduction of a large-scale prediction benchmark, encouraging researchers from all backgrounds to submit work on meaningful, efficient and robust evaluation of LLMs. The workshop will also host the <a href=\"https://repronlp.github.io/\">ReproNLP shared task on reproducibility of evaluations in NLP</a>, with a presentation of (i) the task and results overview by the organisers, and (ii) the results of the individual reproductions by the participants.</p>\n<h2 id=\"user-content-overview\">Overview</h2>\n<p>Evaluating large language models (LLMs) is challenging. Running LLMs over medium or large scale corpus can be prohibitively expensive; they are consistently shown to be highly sensitive to prompt phrasing, and it is hard to formulate metrics which differentiate and rank different LLMs in a meaningful way. Consequently, the validity of the results obtained over popular benchmarks such as <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09110\">HELM</a> or <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.03300v3\">MMLU</a>, lead to brittle conclusions (<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.11324\">Sclar er al., 2024</a>, <a href=\"https://aclanthology.org/2024.tacl-1.52/\">Mizrahi et al., 2024</a>, <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.01781v2\">Alzahrani et al., 2024</a>). We believe that meaningful, efficient, and robust evaluation is one of the cornerstones of the scientific method, and that achieving it should be a community-wide goal.</p>\n<p>In this workshop we seek innovative research relating to the evaluation of LLMs and language generation systems in general. This includes, but is not limited to, robust, reproducible and efficient evaluation metrics, as well as new approaches for collecting evaluation data which can help in better differentiating between different systems and understanding their current bottlenecks.</p>\n<p>To facilitate and spur research in this field we will publish a large dataset of 1B model predictions together with prompts and gold standard references. This dataset will go beyond reporting just the accuracy of a model on a given sample, and will also include various axes which identify how the prompt was created and which were found to affect performance (instruction template, few-shot examples, their order, delimiters, etc.), as well as any known information about the model (pre training corpora, type of instruction-tuning, different checkpoints, and more), and the annotated gold label. Through this dataset, researchers will be able to investigate key questions such as: Are larger models more robust across different prompting configurations? Are common enumerators (e.g., A/B, 1/2) less sensitive compared to rare ones (e.g., I/IV, #/$)? Which evaluation axes should be prioritized when testing with limited resources? Can we identify patterns distinguishing examples where models show high robustness (consistent answers across configurations) versus low robustness (varying answers)?</p>\n<p>We welcome submissions related, but not limited to, the following topics:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>ðŸ’Ž Automatic evaluation of generation systems (<a href=\"https://aclanthology.org/2021.gem-1.8/\">Wang et al., 2021</a>, <a href=\"https://aclanthology.org/2021.gem-1.1/\">Tanprasert and Kauchak, 2021</a>, <a href=\"https://aclanthology.org/2022.gem-1.26/\">PopoviÄ‡ et al., 2022</a>).</li>\n<li>ðŸ’Ž Creating evaluation corpora and challenge sets (<a href=\"https://aclanthology.org/2022.tacl-1.4/\">Kerutzer et al., 2022</a>, <a href=\"https://openreview.net/forum?id=CSi1eu_2q96\">Mille et al., 2021</a>, <a href=\"https://aclanthology.org/2022.gem-1.6/\">Chuklin et al., 2022</a>).</li>\n<li>ðŸ’Ž Critiques of benchmarking efforts and responsibly measuring progress in LLMs (<a href=\"https://aclanthology.org/2020.emnlp-main.393/\">Ethayarajh and Jurafsky, 2020</a>, <a href=\"https://openreview.net/forum?id=j6NxpQbREA1\">Raji et al., 2021</a>).</li>\n<li>ðŸ’Ž Effective and/or efficient NLG methods that can be applied to a wide range of languages and/or scenarios (<a href=\"https://aclanthology.org/2020.tacl-1.47/\">Liu et al., 2020</a>, <a href=\"https://aclanthology.org/2021.gem-1.16/\">DeLucia et al., 2021</a>, <a href=\"https://aclanthology.org/2022.gem-1.1/\">Pernes et al., 2022</a>).</li>\n<li>ðŸ’Ž Application and evaluation of LLMs interacting with external data and tools (<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04761\">Schick et al., 2023</a>, <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09842\">Lu et al., 2023</a>, <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07842\">Mialon et al., 2023</a>).</li>\n<li>ðŸ’Ž Evaluation of sociotechnical systems employing large language models (<a href=\"https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3531146.3533088\">Weidinger et al., 2022</a>).</li>\n<li>ðŸ’Ž Standardizing human evaluation and making it more robust (<a href=\"https://aclanthology.org/2021.tacl-1.87/\">Freitag et al., 2021</a>, <a href=\"https://aclanthology.org/2022.humeval-1.7/\">SaldÃ­as Fuentes et al., 2022</a>, <a href=\"https://aclanthology.org/2022.gem-1.12/\">Mousavi et al., 2022</a>).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We further invite submissions that conduct in-depth analyses of outputs of existing systems, for example through error analyses, by applying new metrics, or by testing the system on new test sets.
