Then, they used a crowd-sourcing procedure to paraphrase these outlines to natural language utterances.\nThis novel crowd-sourcing procedure preserves all annotations obtained from the simulator and does not require any extra annotations after dialogue collection.</p>\n<h3 id=\"user-content-why-is-this-dataset-part-of-gem\">Why is this dataset part of GEM?</h3>\n<p>Schema-Guided Dialog is one of the three datasets representing Dialog Generation NLG in GEM.</p>\n<h3 id=\"user-content-languages\">Languages</h3>\n<p>The text in the datset is in English (<code>en</code>).</p>\n<h2 id=\"user-content-meta-information\">Meta Information</h2>\n<h3 id=\"user-content-dataset-curators\">Dataset Curators</h3>\n<p>The dataset was curated by a team of researchers from Google: Abhinav Rastogi, Xiaoxue Zang, Srinivas Sunkara, Raghav Gupta, Pranav Khaitan, Amir Fayazi, Maria Wang, and Guan-Lin Chao.</p>\n<h3 id=\"user-content-licensing-information\">Licensing Information</h3>\n<p>The dataset is released under <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/\">CC BY-SA 4.0</a> license.

The dialogue simulator interacts with the services to generate dialogue outlines. It consists of two agents playing the roles of the user and the system, interacting with each other using a finite set of actions specified through dialogue acts over a probabilistic automaton designed to capture varied dialogue trajectories. It is worth noting that the simulation automaton does not include any domain-specific constraints: all domain-specific constraints are encoded in the schema and scenario.</p>\n<p>The dialogue paraphrasing framework then converts the outlines generated by the simulator into a natural conversation. Users may refer to the slot values in the dialogue acts in various different ways during the conversation, e.g., “los angeles” may be referred to as “LA” or “LAX”. To introduce these natural variations in the slot values, different slot values are replaced with a randomly selected variation while being kept consistent across user turns in a dialogue. The actions are then converted to pseudo-natural language utterances using a set of manually defined action-to-text templates, and the resulting utterances for the different actions in a turn are concatenated together.</p>\n<p>Finally, the dialogue transformed by these steps is sent to the crowd workers to be reformulated into more natural language. One crowd worker is tasked with paraphrasing all utterances of a dialogue to ensure naturalness and coherence. The crowd workers are asked to exactly repeat the slot values in their paraphrases so that the span indices for the slots can be recovered via string matching.</p>\n<h4 id=\"user-content-who-are-the-source-language-producers\">Who are the source language producers?</h4>\n<p>The language structure is machine-generated, and the language realizations are produced by crowd workers.\nThe dataset paper does not provide demographic information for the crowd workers.</p>\n<h3 id=\"user-content-annotations\">Annotations</h3>\n<p>The annotations are automatically obtained during the initial sampling process and by string matching after reformulation. Therefore, no further annotation is needed.</p>\n<h3 id=\"user-content-personal-and-sensitive-information\">Personal and Sensitive Information</h3>\n<p>The SGD dataset does not use identity categories and does not contain sensitive data.</p>\n<h2 id=\"user-content-changes-to-the-original-dataset-for-gem\">Changes to the Original Dataset for GEM</h2>\n<p>We are focusing on the response-generation part of the dataset and thus reformatted the dataset to treat the service agent utterances as the targets to be generated and the previous customer utterance and the agent's dialog act as the input.
