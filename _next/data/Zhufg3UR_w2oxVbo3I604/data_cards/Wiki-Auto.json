While <code>auto_acl</code> corresponds to the filtered version of the data used to train the systems in the paper, <code>auto_full_no_split</code> and <code>auto_full_with_split</code> correspond to the unfiltered versions with and without sentence splits respectively. In the <code>auto_full_with_split</code> config, we join the sentences in the simple article mapped to the same sentence in the complex article to capture sentence splitting. Split sentences are seperated by a <code>&#x3C;SEP></code> token. In the <code>auto_full_no_split config</code>, we do not join the splits and treat them as seperate pairs. An instance is a single pair of sentences:</p>\n<pre><code>{'normal_sentence': 'In early work, Rutherford discovered the concept of radioactive half-life , the radioactive element radon, and differentiated and named alpha and beta radiation .\\n',\n 'simple_sentence': 'Rutherford discovered the radioactive half-life, and the three parts of radiation which he named Alpha, Beta, and Gamma.\\n'}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Thus, for training a text simplification model for GEM, the data with the <code>auto_acl</code> config can be directly used.</p>\n<h3 id=\"data-fields\">Data Fields</h3>\n<p>The data has the following field:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>normal_sentence</code>: a sentence from English Wikipedia.</li>\n<li><code>normal_sentence_id</code>: a unique ID for each English Wikipedia sentence.
