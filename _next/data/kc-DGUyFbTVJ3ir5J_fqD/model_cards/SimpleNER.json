We provide examples of such analyses in the following two paragraphs.</p>\n<p>Consider for example a model pre-trained on English Wikipedia and fine-tuned on a summarization dataset, and imagine that such a model is deployed in a news website to provide automatic summaries. Given the gender gap on Wikipedia, we can imagine two possible effects:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>the model could systematically produce summaries with lower ROUGE scores when compared to a reference for articles describing women than it would for articles describing men.</li>\n<li>the model may be less likely to name the subject of an article if the subject is a woman than if the subject is a man.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We can measure either of these effects by running an entity linking system on the articles, for example, and comparing subsets of the test set where the gender of the actors is known.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, imagine that a system that is fine-tuned on WikiAuto, which aligns English Wikipedia text to its Simple English Wikipedia version, is used in an attempt to make a blog where the writer talks about their personal experience more accessible. How well does the model handle the shift from a third person to a first person point of view? One way we can check whether the behavior is roughly the same is by comparing the copy rate (number of words from the input that are re-used in the output) between the Wikipedia and blog setting.</p>\n<p>We ask you to take a similar approach to analyzing your model:</p>\n<h3 id=\"additional-data\">Additional Data</h3>\n<p><em>If you used a model that was pre-trained on additional data or used additional data, please describe it.

(recorded as: &#x3C;LevSim_x.xx> )\n- Word Rank: Ratio of the average of the third-quartile log ranks of the words (excluding stopwords and special tokens) in the simple and complex sentence (extracted from the order of FastText word embeddings being used for training). (recorded as: &#x3C;WordRank_x.xx>)\n- Dependency Tree Depth: Ratio of the maximum dependency tree depth of the simple and complex sentence.

Additionally, it proves helpful for second language learners, especially in public service centres such as airports or health clinics. A model such as ours can be utilized to produce point-to-point simplifications for such people, and therefore must be made more accessible, but more importantly, must be made more reliable and faithful in terms of the original information/ message it must convey.  Even with nearly 300k aligned sentence pairs, train sets such as WikiLarge fail to help large transformer models being trained from scratch to generalize well,  which causes them to suffer from data sparsity, which can be observed with words in the vocabulary having very high word ranks (ordered by frequency), such as named entities. We attempted to mitigate this issue by replacing the named entities in our data with (18) special tokens before training, which are promptly replaced back with the original tokens. This helps to reduce the model vocabulary, and allows for greater generalization.  Although this step is beneficial to the overall performance of the model, it also brings with it a negative effect. The idea of replacing NEs is based on the assumption that such tokens or phrases need not be modified or deleted during the task of simplification. Although this is true for the most part when it comes to evaluation sets like the TurkCorpus and ASSET, potentially complex named entities need to be simplified or elaborated upon in real life uses, especially if the use involves second language learners or people with reading disabilities.  Eg. Consider an input statement as “Counters 3-6 are reserved for Commissioned Military Personnel.” Ideally, a simplified sentence should read something along the lines of “Counters 3-6 may be used only by army officers.” However, since Commissioned Military Personnel would be excluded from the simplification process by virtue of being a named entity, this simplification would not take place.</p>\n<h3 id=\"measuring-impact\">Measuring Impact</h3>\n<p><em>Propose a method to test the magnitude of the impact identified in your previous answer</em></p>\n<p>Gauging the need for elaboration or replacement of a named entity in a sentence requires a strong proficiency in the parent language and at least some knowledge of the named entity itself. Therefore this task is best suited for manual evaluation where annotators must be asked to rate the simplification upon how well were the constituent named entities simplified or elaborated. This can be done using a simple Likert-scale.</p>\n<p>However, as manual evaluation is slow and resource intensive, there is a need for automated evaluation methods to approximate human judgment. A possible way to quantify the need for replacement or elaboration of named entities is the average similarity the NE holds to the other words in the sentence. If a NE with a high word rank shows very little similarity to the words in the sentence, it is likely that the sentence does not attempt to elaborate/ explain the NE. On the other hand, a high average similarity indicates that there are other words in the sentence that are related to the NE, and are most likely being used to elaborate upon the NE. A simple formulation of this measure can be the product of the word rank of the NE and its average similarity with other words in the sentence. Still, there is clearly a need for more nuanced methods of evaluation for text simplification, which capture the performance of a model on such attributes and expected operations.</p>\n<h2 id=\"reproducibility\">Reproducibility</h2>\n<p><em>In this section, we ask you to provide any information that would be required for someone to reproduce your model and experimental results.
