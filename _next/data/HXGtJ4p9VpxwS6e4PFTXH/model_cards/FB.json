We provide examples of such analyses in the following two paragraphs.</p>\n<p>Consider for example a model pre-trained on English Wikipedia and fine-tuned on a summarization dataset, and imagine that such a model is deployed in a news website to provide automatic summaries. Given the gender gap on Wikipedia, we can imagine two possible effects:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>the model could systematically produce summaries with lower ROUGE scores when compared to a reference for articles describing women than it would for articles describing men.</li>\n<li>the model may be less likely to name the subject of an article if the subject is a woman than if the subject is a man.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We can measure either of these effects by running an entity linking system on the articles, for example, and comparing subsets of the test set where the gender of the actors is known.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, imagine that a system that is fine-tuned on WikiAuto, which aligns English Wikipedia text to its Simple English Wikipedia version, is used in an attempt to make a blog where the writer talks about their personal experience more accessible. How well does the model handle the shift from a third person to a first person point of view? One way we can check whether the behavior is roughly the same is by comparing the copy rate (number of words from the input that are re-used in the output) between the Wikipedia and blog setting.</p>\n<p>We ask you to take a similar approach to analyzing your model:</p>\n<h3 id=\"additional-data\">Additional Data</h3>\n<p><em>If you used a model that was pre-trained on additional data or used additional data, please describe it.

If a data augmentation technique was used, describe the technique</em></p>\n<p>We passed the SGD through the Google templates and augmented with the service name and five turns of preceding context.</p>\n<p>For WebNLG, we preprocessed the dataset based on the implicit tree structure ordering from Yang et al. (2020). We additionally sorted siblings by increasing subtree depth, breaking ties by sorting alphabetically on predicate names.</p>\n<p>For E2E, no additional pre-processing of that data was performed.</p>\n<p>We then fine-tuned a BART-Large model to generate the target responses using these inputs.  We also trained a BART-Large model to reconstruct the input from the generated response.  For SGD and WebNLG, this model included the service/domain name in the input as well and was trained to reconstruct the templated input (without context for SGD).</p>\n<p>Using these models, we ran 2 iterations of self-training, where we created unpaired inputs by deleting subsets of the input dialog acts, randomly choosing up to 20 unpaired inputs per original input.  In each self-training iteration, we ran the generator on the unpaired inputs and then the reconstruction model on the resulting responses, keeping those that yielded an exact match with the original input and adding them to the training data for retraining the generator and reconstruction models.</p>\n<p>We noted that for the case of SGD, the self-trained model was susceptible to stuttering, i.e., repeating the same phrase over and over again. This was not observed in the BART-Large generation model. Hence, to control for stuttering, for each response generated by the self-trained model, we used the heuristic that if any word (excluding stop words such as articles, conjunctions, etc.) was repeated in the generated response more than 5 times; we preferred the response generated by the BART-Large model instead.</p>\n<p>Finally, we passed the generated responses for a dataset to an acceptability classifier that selected the first generated response in a 5-best list that passed the acceptability test for output (or the 1-best output if no responses passed the test). We filtered out the responses from the 5-best list that had an unacceptability score > threshold, and the top response was selected from the remaining. In the case of all responses getting filtered out, the original 1-best response was selected.</p>\n<p>We trained an acceptability classifier for each dataset using the training data provided for that dataset and further augmenting it by generating synthetic positive and negative responses to augment those in the training data. The synthetic data was created by mask filling using the BART-Large generator (prior to self-training) fine-tuned on the original training data, with the resulting synthesized responses passed through a RoBERTa-large-mnli entailment model to determine whether they were acceptable (i.e., paraphrases of the seed response) or unacceptable (semantically inaccurate compared to the seed response).  Finally, the resulting data was used to train a RoBERTa-base classifier for predicting response acceptability.</p>\n<h3 id=\"real-world-use\">Real-World Use</h3>\n<p><em>Describe a possible real-use application of your model, then choose one of the steps (e.g. choice of the pre-trained model, data source, data augmentation, training loss, etc.) above and describe a negative impact it may have on the user experience</em></p>\n<p>BART is a pre-trained model whose training data is perhaps not as well-studied as it could be (as is apparently true of all pre-trained models).   Our SGD model conditions on the context and uses BART, and thus would be susceptible to being triggered into generating unsafe (malicious, racist, sexist, etc.) language by certain words that the user provides if it were to be deployed with no safety rails. We could estimate how susceptible the model might be to adversarial attacks by examining how often it copied a word from the context that was outside the training vocabulary. More sophisticated analyses could follow the methods of Dinan et al. (<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.06083)\">https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.06083)</a>.  As noted above, this could lead to unsafe responses getting generated in real-word use-cases such as Dialog systems for Assistants.</p>\n<h3 id=\"measuring-impact\">Measuring Impact</h3>\n<p><em>Propose a method to test the magnitude of the impact identified in your previous answer</em></p>\n<p>As noted earlier, Dinan et al. have proposed a method (<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.06083\">https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.06083</a>) for adversarial analysis that could be pursued to investigate this issue.  Subsequent work (e.g., Xu et al., <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.07079\">https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.07079</a>) has investigated ways of improving safety, but this remains an open problem.</p>\n<h2 id=\"reproducibility\">Reproducibility</h2>\n<p><em>In this section, we ask you to provide any information that would be required for someone to reproduce your model and experimental results.

The small increase could be explained by the inclusion of the service name in the input.  Subsequently, we used a different version of BLEU to compare models as the GEM-metrics were not easy to use in our standard computing environment.  We compared BART-Base and BART-Large models with and without templatizing the inputs and with 0, 1 or 5 turns of preceding context, finding that BART-Large with 5 turns of preceding context and templatized inputs worked the best. We then ran 2 rounds of self-training (each round having alternating generation and reconstruction), and observed improvements in the reconstruction match accuracy during this process, even though BLEU scores were either slightly decreased or stayed the same.</p>\n<p>When selecting responses using acceptability classifier, we further analyzed the cases where the selected response was different than the one outputted by the generation model, using a 2-way entailment (to establish paraphrases) via Roberta-large-mnli model between target and selected responses as well as target and original responses. We verified that there were more paraphrases in the former compared to the latter, as well as manually looked at a random sample in each case. We noted that BLEU scores were slightly changed (either increased or decreased) when adding the Acceptability Classifier, but the number of paraphrases (generated response w.r.t target response) were increased.</p>\n","title":"Self-Training, Acceptability Classifiers and Context-Conditioning","type":"Shared Task 2021","background":"BART together with RoBERTa classifiers and context."}},"__N_SSG":true}
