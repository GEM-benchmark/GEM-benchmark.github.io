<h2 id="social-impact">Social Impact</h2>
<p>In this section, we ask you to provide information on all of the steps that went into obtaining your models, especially in regards to how they would affect a user’s interactions with the technology if it was deployed in a live system.</p>
<p>Then, please choose one of these steps to analyze in terms of possible negative impacts on potential direct and indirect users, and propose a test to evaluate the existence and magnitude of that impact. We provide examples of such analyses in the following two paragraphs.</p>
<p>Consider for example a model pre-trained on English Wikipedia and fine-tuned on a summarization dataset, and imagine that such a model is deployed in a news website to provide automatic summaries. Given the gender gap on Wikipedia, we can imagine two possible effects:</p>
<ol>
<li>the model could systematically produce summaries with lower ROUGE scores when compared to a reference for articles describing women than it would for articles describing men.</li>
<li>the model may be less likely to name the subject of an article if the subject is a woman than if the subject is a man.</li>
</ol>
<p>We can measure either of these effects by running an entity linking system on the articles, for example, and comparing subsets of the test set where the gender of the actors is known.</p>
<p>Alternatively, imagine that a system that is fine-tuned on WikiAuto, which aligns English Wikipedia text to its Simple English Wikipedia version, is used in an attempt to make a blog where the writer talks about their personal experience more accessible. How well does the model handle the shift from a third person to a first person point of view? One way we can check whether the behavior is roughly the same is by comparing the copy rate (number of words from the input that are re-used in the output) between the Wikipedia and blog setting.</p>
<p>We ask you to take a similar approach to analyzing your model:</p>

<h3 id="training-process">Training Process</h3>
<p><em>Describe the training or fine tuning setup, including whether the final model was trained on a single task or in a multi-task setting. If a data augmentation technique was used, describe the technique</em></p>
<p>The transformer model is trained (single-task) from scratch on the ~290k sentence pairs from the WikiLarge corpus (already having the named-entities replaced by special tokens), with pre-trained FastText embeddings loaded.</p>
<ol>
<li>Named-Entity tagging:</li>
</ol>
<p>Instances of named entities identified by Flair’s Ontonotes model, occurring on the complex half of the data, are replaced by respective special tokens:</p>
<p>Eg. New York --> LOC (tag predicted by NER model) --> LOC@1 (‘New York’ replaced by unique tag, while the respective token-tag mapping is saved sentence-wise for de-tagging after output generation)</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Adding Control Tokens:</li>
</ol>
<p>Once the sentence pairs have been pruned and NER-tagged, four control attributes (Martin et. al., 2020) (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.02677">https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.02677</a>) are calculated between each of the complex and simple sentence pairs:
- Compression Ratio: Simple ratio between token lengths of the simple and complex sentences. (recorded as: &#x3C;NbChars_x.xx>)
- Levenshtein Distance: Normalised character level Levenshtein distance between the complex and simple sentence. (recorded as: &#x3C;LevSim_x.xx> )
- Word Rank: Ratio of the average of the third-quartile log ranks of the words (excluding stopwords and special tokens) in the simple and complex sentence (extracted from the order of FastText word embeddings being used for training). (recorded as: &#x3C;WordRank_x.xx>)
- Dependency Tree Depth: Ratio of the maximum dependency tree depth of the simple and complex sentence. (recorded as: &#x3C;DepTreeDepth_x.xx>)</p>
<p>Eg.
Complex: it is particularly famous for the cultivation of kiwifruit .
Simple: it is mostly famous for the growing of kiwifruit .</p>
<p>Rewriting complex:
&#x3C;NbChars_0.8> &#x3C;LevSim_0.76> &#x3C;WordRank_0.79> it is particularly famous for the cultivation of kiwifruit .</p>
<h3 id="real-world-use">Real-World Use</h3>
<p><em>Describe a possible real-use application of your model, then choose one of the steps (e.g. choice of the pre-trained model, data source, data augmentation, training loss, etc.) above and describe a negative impact it may have on the user experience</em></p>
<p>Text Simplification has always found crucial importance in making it easier for people with cognitive disabilities such as aphasia, dyslexia and autism, to read and understand text. Additionally, it proves helpful for second language learners, especially in public service centres such as airports or health clinics. A model such as ours can be utilized to produce point-to-point simplifications for such people, and therefore must be made more accessible, but more importantly, must be made more reliable and faithful in terms of the original information/ message it must convey.  Even with nearly 300k aligned sentence pairs, train sets such as WikiLarge fail to help large transformer models being trained from scratch to generalize well,  which causes them to suffer from data sparsity, which can be observed with words in the vocabulary having very high word ranks (ordered by frequency), such as named entities. We attempted to mitigate this issue by replacing the named entities in our data with (18) special tokens before training, which are promptly replaced back with the original tokens. This helps to reduce the model vocabulary, and allows for greater generalization.  Although this step is beneficial to the overall performance of the model, it also brings with it a negative effect. The idea of replacing NEs is based on the assumption that such tokens or phrases need not be modified or deleted during the task of simplification. Although this is true for the most part when it comes to evaluation sets like the TurkCorpus and ASSET, potentially complex named entities need to be simplified or elaborated upon in real life uses, especially if the use involves second language learners or people with reading disabilities.  Eg. Consider an input statement as “Counters 3-6 are reserved for Commissioned Military Personnel.” Ideally, a simplified sentence should read something along the lines of “Counters 3-6 may be used only by army officers.” However, since Commissioned Military Personnel would be excluded from the simplification process by virtue of being a named entity, this simplification would not take place.</p>
<h3 id="measuring-impact">Measuring Impact</h3>
<p><em>Propose a method to test the magnitude of the impact identified in your previous answer</em></p>
<p>Gauging the need for elaboration or replacement of a named entity in a sentence requires a strong proficiency in the parent language and at least some knowledge of the named entity itself. Therefore this task is best suited for manual evaluation where annotators must be asked to rate the simplification upon how well were the constituent named entities simplified or elaborated. This can be done using a simple Likert-scale.</p>
<p>However, as manual evaluation is slow and resource intensive, there is a need for automated evaluation methods to approximate human judgment. A possible way to quantify the need for replacement or elaboration of named entities is the average similarity the NE holds to the other words in the sentence. If a NE with a high word rank shows very little similarity to the words in the sentence, it is likely that the sentence does not attempt to elaborate/ explain the NE. On the other hand, a high average similarity indicates that there are other words in the sentence that are related to the NE, and are most likely being used to elaborate upon the NE. A simple formulation of this measure can be the product of the word rank of the NE and its average similarity with other words in the sentence. Still, there is clearly a need for more nuanced methods of evaluation for text simplification, which capture the performance of a model on such attributes and expected operations.</p>

Additionally, it proves helpful for second language learners, especially in public service centres such as airports or health clinics. A model such as ours can be utilized to produce point-to-point simplifications for such people, and therefore must be made more accessible, but more importantly, must be made more reliable and faithful in terms of the original information/ message it must convey.  Even with nearly 300k aligned sentence pairs, train sets such as WikiLarge fail to help large transformer models being trained from scratch to generalize well,  which causes them to suffer from data sparsity, which can be observed with words in the vocabulary having very high word ranks (ordered by frequency), such as named entities. We attempted to mitigate this issue by replacing the named entities in our data with (18) special tokens before training, which are promptly replaced back with the original tokens. This helps to reduce the model vocabulary, and allows for greater generalization.  Although this step is beneficial to the overall performance of the model, it also brings with it a negative effect. The idea of replacing NEs is based on the assumption that such tokens or phrases need not be modified or deleted during the task of simplification. Although this is true for the most part when it comes to evaluation sets like the TurkCorpus and ASSET, potentially complex named entities need to be simplified or elaborated upon in real life uses, especially if the use involves second language learners or people with reading disabilities.  Eg. Consider an input statement as “Counters 3-6 are reserved for Commissioned Military Personnel.” Ideally, a simplified sentence should read something along the lines of “Counters 3-6 may be used only by army officers.” However, since Commissioned Military Personnel would be excluded from the simplification process by virtue of being a named entity, this simplification would not take place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"measuring-impact\"\u003eMeasuring Impact\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003ePropose a method to test the magnitude of the impact identified in your previous answer\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGauging the need for elaboration or replacement of a named entity in a sentence requires a strong proficiency in the parent language and at least some knowledge of the named entity itself. Therefore this task is best suited for manual evaluation where annotators must be asked to rate the simplification upon how well were the constituent named entities simplified or elaborated. This can be done using a simple Likert-scale.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, as manual evaluation is slow and resource intensive, there is a need for automated evaluation methods to approximate human judgment. A possible way to quantify the need for replacement or elaboration of named entities is the average similarity the NE holds to the other words in the sentence. If a NE with a high word rank shows very little similarity to the words in the sentence, it is likely that the sentence does not attempt to elaborate/ explain the NE. On the other hand, a high average similarity indicates that there are other words in the sentence that are related to the NE, and are most likely being used to elaborate upon the NE. A simple formulation of this measure can be the product of the word rank of the NE and its average similarity with other words in the sentence. Still, there is clearly a need for more nuanced methods of evaluation for text simplification, which capture the performance of a model on such attributes and expected operations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"reproducibility\"\u003eReproducibility\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eIn this section, we ask you to provide any information that would be required for someone to reproduce your model and experimental results.
