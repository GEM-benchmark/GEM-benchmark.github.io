## Keynotes

### Keynote 1 - Sean Welleck

#### Reflections on Trusting Untrustworthy Language Generators

**ABSTRACT**

In his 1984 Turing Award Lecture “Reflections on Trusting Trust”, Ken Thompson famously said “You can’t trust code that you did not totally create yourself”. These words are especially relevant today, as powerful and flexible language models generate natural language and code that is increasingly human-like. However, these same systems challenge our trust, exhibiting odd degeneracies, amplifying biases, and producing flawed reasoning. In this talk, I will introduce two directions for harnessing the potential of these language models while mitigating the risks. First, I will discuss unlearning: removing undesirable behaviors by integrating feedback and learning. Second, I will discuss how integrating language models with trustworthy symbolic systems can open the door to tackling challenging mathematical reasoning tasks. Join me as we explore the path towards trusting untrustworthy language generators.

**BIO**

Sean Welleck is a Postdoctoral Scholar at the University of Washington and the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence, working with Yejin Choi. His research focuses on algorithms for natural language generation and machine reasoning, with the aim of minimizing the effort needed to trust the output of AI systems. He has developed unlearning, decoding, and evaluation algorithms for controllable neural language generation, and methods for integrating language models with symbolic systems, with a particular focus on mathematical reasoning. He received his Ph.D. from New York University, where he was advised by Kyunghyun Cho. Outside of his research activities, he hosts the Thesis Review Podcast and enjoys running long distances.

### Keynote 2 - Timo Schick

#### Instructable and Collaborative Language Models

**ABSTRACT**

Textual content is often the output of a collaborative writing process — which includes writing text, making comments and changes, finding references, and asking others for help —, but today’s NLP models are only trained to generate the final output of this process. In this talk, we will discuss an alternative approach where models are trained to imitate the entire writing process. We will look at examples of how this enables models to plan and explain their actions, to correct their own mistakes, and to better collaborate with humans. We will also discuss how to make such models better at following human-written instructions.

**BIO**

Timo Schick is a research scientist at FAIR working on few-shot learning in NLP. Previously, he did his PhD at the Center for Information and Language Processing (CIS) in Munich and worked in industry as a data scientist for several years. Timo's current research focuses on instruction-based learning and teaching language models to collaborate with other entities.
