title: viggo
type: Data-to-Text
languages: English
summary: ViGGO is an English data-to-text generation dataset in the video game domain, with target responses being more conversational than information-seeking, yet constrained to the information presented in a meaning representation. The dataset is relatively small with about 5,000 datasets but very clean, and can thus serve for evaluating transfer learning, low-resource, or few-shot capabilities of neural models.
