title: common_gen
type: Reasoning
languages: English
summary: CommonGen is an English text generation task to explicitly test machines for the ability of generative commonsense reasoning. Given a set of common concepts, the task is to generate a coherent sentence describing an everyday scenario using these concepts. CommonGen is challenging because it inherently requires 1) relational reasoning using background commonsense knowledge, and 2) compositional generalization ability to work on unseen concept combinations. The dataset, constructed through a combination of crowd-sourcing from AMT and existing caption corpora, consists of 30k concept-sets and 50k sentences in total. Note that the CommonGen test set is private and requires submission to the external leaderboard.
