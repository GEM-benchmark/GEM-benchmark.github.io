summary: Abductive reasoning is inference to the most plausible explanation. For example, if Jenny finds her house in a mess when she returns from work, and remembers that she left a window open, she can hypothesize that a thief broke into her house and caused the mess, as the most plausible explanation. This data loader focuses on abductive NLG - a conditional English generation task for explaining given observations in natural language.
