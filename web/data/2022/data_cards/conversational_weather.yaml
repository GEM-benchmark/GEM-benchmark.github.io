summary: The purpose of this dataset is to assess how well a model can learn a template-like structure in a very low data setting. The task here is to produce a response to a weather-related query. The reply is further specified through the data attributes and discourse structure in the input. The output contains both the lexicalized text and discourse markers for attributes (e.g., _ARG_TEMP_ 34).
