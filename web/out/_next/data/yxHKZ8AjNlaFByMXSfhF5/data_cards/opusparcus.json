The development\n              and test sets consist of sentence pairs that have been annotated manually; each set contains approximately\n              1000 sentence pairs that have been verified to be acceptable paraphrases by two independent annotators.\n            </p>\n            <p>When you download Opusparcus, you must always indicate the language you want to retrieve, for instance:\n            </p>\n\n            <div class=\"code-wrapper\">\n              <div class=\"toolbar\">\n                <div class=\"copy-icon\" title=\"Click to copy code block\"></div>\n                <div class=\"expand-modal-icon\" title=\"Click to expand code block\"></div>\n              </div>\n              <pre><code>data = load_dataset(\"GEM/opusparcus\", lang=\"de\")\n</code></pre>\n            </div>\n\n            <p>The above command will download the validation and test sets for German.

The quality parameter indicates the estimated proportion (in percent) of true\n              paraphrases in the training set. Allowed quality values range between 60 and 100, in increments of 5 (60,\n              65, 70, ..., 100). A value of 60 means that 60% of the sentence pairs in the training set are estimated to\n              be true paraphrases (and the remaining 40% are not). A higher value produces a smaller but cleaner set.\n              The smaller sets are subsets of the larger sets, such that the <code>quality=95</code> set is a subset of\n              <code>quality=90</code>, which is a subset of <code>quality=85</code>, and so on.</p>\n            <p>The default <code>quality</code> value, if omitted, is 100. This matches no training data at all, which\n              can be convenient, if you are only interested in the validation and test sets, which are considerably\n              smaller, but manually annotated.</p>\n            <p>Note that an alternative to typing the parameter values explicitly, you can use configuration names\n              instead.

[Paraphrase Generation and Evaluation on Colloquial-Style Sentences](https://aclanthology.org/2020.lrec-1.224/), Proceedings of the 12th Language Resources and Evaluation Conference (LREC).\n\n\n\n## Dataset Curation\n\n### Original Curation\n\n#### Original Curation Rationale\n\n&#x3C;!-- info: Original curation rationale -->\n&#x3C;!-- scope: telescope -->\nOpusparcus was created in order to produce a *sentential* paraphrase corpus for multiple languages containing *colloquial* language (as opposed to news or religious text, for instance).\n\n#### Communicative Goal\n\n&#x3C;!-- info: What was the communicative goal? -->\n&#x3C;!-- scope: periscope -->\nOpusparcus provides labeled examples of pairs of sentences that have similar (or dissimilar) meanings.\n\n#### Sourced from Different Sources\n\n&#x3C;!-- info: Is the dataset aggregated from different data sources? -->\n&#x3C;!-- scope: telescope -->\nno\n\n\n### Language Data\n\n#### How was Language Data Obtained?\n\n&#x3C;!-- info: How was the language data obtained? -->\n&#x3C;!-- scope: telescope -->\n`Crowdsourced`\n\n#### Where was it crowdsourced?\n\n&#x3C;!-- info: If crowdsourced, where from? -->\n&#x3C;!-- scope: periscope -->\n`Other crowdworker platform`\n\n#### Language Producers\n\n&#x3C;!-- info: What further information do we have on the language producers? -->\n&#x3C;!-- scope: microscope -->\nThe data in Opusparcus has been extracted from [OpenSubtitles2016](http://opus.nlpl.eu/OpenSubtitles2016.php), which is in turn based on data from [OpenSubtitles.org](http://www.opensubtitles.org/).\n\nThe texts consists of subtitles that have been produced using crowdsourcing.\n\n#### Topics Covered\n\n&#x3C;!-- info: Does the language in the dataset focus on specific topics? How would you describe them? -->\n&#x3C;!-- scope: periscope -->\nThe language is representative of movies and TV shows. Domains covered include comedy, drama, relationships, suspense, etc.\n\n#### Data Validation\n\n&#x3C;!-- info: Was the text validated by a different worker or a data curator? -->\n&#x3C;!-- scope: telescope -->\nvalidated by data curator\n\n#### Data Preprocessing\n\n&#x3C;!-- info: How was the text data pre-processed? (Enter N/A if the text was not pre-processed) -->\n&#x3C;!-- scope: microscope -->\nSentence and word tokenization was performed.\n\n#### Was Data Filtered?\n\n&#x3C;!-- info: Were text instances selected or filtered? -->\n&#x3C;!-- scope: telescope -->\nalgorithmically\n\n#### Filter Criteria\n\n&#x3C;!-- info: What were the selection criteria? -->\n&#x3C;!-- scope: microscope -->\nThe sentence pairs in the training sets were ordered automatically based on the estimated likelihood that the sentences were paraphrases, most likely paraphrases on the top, and least likely paraphrases on the bottom.\n\nThe validation and test sets were checked and annotated manually, but the sentence pairs selected for annotation had to be different enough in terms of minimum edit distance (Levenshtein distance). This ensured that annotators would not spend their time annotating pairs of more or less identical sentences.\n\n\n### Structured Annotations\n\n#### Additional Annotations?\n\n&#x3C;!-- quick -->\n&#x3C;!-- info: Does the dataset have additional annotations for each instance? -->\n&#x3C;!-- scope: telescope -->\nexpert created\n\n#### Number of Raters\n\n&#x3C;!-- info: What is the number of raters -->\n&#x3C;!-- scope: telescope -->\n11&#x3C;n&#x3C;50\n\n#### Rater Qualifications\n\n&#x3C;!-- info: Describe the qualifications required of an annotator. -->\n&#x3C;!-- scope: periscope -->\nStudents and staff at the University of Helsinki (native or very proficient speakers of the target languages)\n\n#### Raters per Training Example\n\n&#x3C;!-- info: How many annotators saw each training example? -->\n&#x3C;!-- scope: periscope -->\n0\n\n#### Raters per Test Example\n\n&#x3C;!-- info: How many annotators saw each test example? -->\n&#x3C;!-- scope: periscope -->\n2\n\n#### Annotation Service?\n\n&#x3C;!-- info: Was an annotation service used? -->\n&#x3C;!-- scope: telescope -->\nno\n\n#### Annotation Values\n\n&#x3C;!-- info: Purpose and values for each annotation -->\n&#x3C;!-- scope: microscope -->\nThe development and test sets consist of sentence pairs that have been annotated manually; each set contains approximately 1000 sentence pairs that have been verified to be acceptable paraphrases by two independent annotators.\n\nThe `annot_score` field reflects the judgments made by the annotators. If the annnotators fully agreed on the category (4.0: dark green, 3.0: light green, 2.0: yellow, 1.0: red), the value of `annot_score` is 4.0, 3.0, 2.0 or 1.0.  If the annotators chose adjacent categories, the value in this field will be 3.5, 2.5 or 1.5.  For instance, a value of 2.5 means that one annotator gave a score of 3 (\"mostly good\"), indicating a possible paraphrase pair, whereas the other annotator scored this as a 2 (\"mostly bad\"), that is, unlikely to be a paraphrase pair.  If the annotators disagreed by more than one category, the sentence pair was discarded and won't show up in the datasets.\n\nAnnotators could also reject a sentence pair as being corrupted data.\n\n#### Any Quality Control?\n\n&#x3C;!-- info: Quality control measures? -->\n&#x3C;!-- scope: telescope -->\nvalidated by another rater\n\n#### Quality Control Details\n\n&#x3C;!-- info: Describe the quality control measures that were taken. -->\n&#x3C;!-- scope: microscope -->\nIf the annotators disagreed by more than one category, the sentence pair was discarded and is not part of the final dataset.\n\n\n### Consent\n\n#### Any Consent Policy?\n\n&#x3C;!-- info: Was there a consent policy involved when gathering the data? -->\n&#x3C;!-- scope: telescope -->\nno\n\n\n### Private Identifying Information (PII)\n\n#### Contains PII?\n\n&#x3C;!-- quick -->\n&#x3C;!-- info: Does the source language data likely contain Personal Identifying Information about the data creators or subjects? -->\n&#x3C;!-- scope: telescope -->\nyes/very likely\n\n#### Any PII Identification?\n\n&#x3C;!-- info: Did the curators use any automatic/manual method to identify PII in the dataset? -->\n&#x3C;!-- scope: periscope -->\nno identification\n\n\n### Maintenance\n\n#### Any Maintenance Plan?\n\n&#x3C;!-- info: Does the original dataset have a maintenance plan? -->\n&#x3C;!-- scope: telescope -->\nno\n\n\n\n## Broader Social Context\n\n### Previous Work on the Social Impact of the Dataset\n\n#### Usage of Models based on the Data\n\n&#x3C;!-- info: Are you aware of cases where models trained on the task featured in this dataset ore related tasks have been used in automated systems? -->\n&#x3C;!-- scope: telescope -->\nno\n\n\n### Impact on Under-Served Communities\n\n#### Addresses needs of underserved Communities?\n\n&#x3C;!-- info: Does this dataset address the needs of communities that are traditionally underserved in language technology, and particularly language generation technology? Communities may be underserved for exemple because their language, language variety, or social or geographical context is underepresented in NLP and NLG resources (datasets and models). -->\n&#x3C;!-- scope: telescope -->\nno\n\n\n### Discussion of Biases\n\n#### Any Documented Social Biases?\n\n&#x3C;!-- info: Are there documented social biases in the dataset? Biases in this context are variations in the ways members of different social categories are represented that can have harmful downstream consequences for members of the more disadvantaged group. -->\n&#x3C;!-- scope: telescope -->\nno\n\n#### Are the Language Producers Representative of the Language?\n\n&#x3C;!-- info: Does the distribution of language producers in the dataset accurately represent the full distribution of speakers of the language world-wide? If not, how does it differ? -->\n&#x3C;!-- scope: periscope -->\nWhat social bias there may be in the subtitles in this dataset has not been studied.\n\n\n\n## Considerations for Using the Data\n\n### PII Risks and Liability\n\n#### Potential PII Risk\n\n&#x3C;!-- info: Considering your answers to the PII part of the Data Curation Section, describe any potential privacy to the data subjects and creators risks when using the dataset. -->\n&#x3C;!-- scope: microscope -->\nThe data only contains subtitles of publicly available movies and TV shows.\n\n\n### Licenses\n\n#### Copyright Restrictions on the Dataset\n\n&#x3C;!-- info: Based on your answers in the Intended Use part of the Data Overview Section, which of the following best describe the copyright and licensing status of the dataset? -->\n&#x3C;!-- scope: periscope -->\n`non-commercial use only`\n\n#### Copyright Restrictions on the Language Data\n\n&#x3C;!-- info: Based on your answers in the Language part of the Data Curation Section, which of the following best describe the copyright and licensing status of the underlying language data? -->\n&#x3C;!-- scope: periscope -->\n`non-commercial use only`\n\n\n### Known Technical Limitations\n\n#### Technical Limitations\n\n&#x3C;!-- info: Describe any known technical limitations, such as spurrious correlations, train/test overlap, annotation biases, or mis-annotations, and cite the works that first identified these limitations when possible. -->\n&#x3C;!-- scope: microscope -->\nSome subtitles contain typos that are caused by inaccurate OCR.\n\n#### Unsuited Applications\n\n&#x3C;!-- info: When using a model trained on this dataset in a setting where users or the public may interact with its predictions, what are some pitfalls to look out for? In particular, describe some applications of the general task featured in this dataset that its curation or properties make it less suitable for. -->\n&#x3C;!-- scope: microscope -->\nThe models might memorize individual subtitles of existing movies and TV shows, but there is no context across sentence boundaries in the data.\n\n#### Discouraged Use Cases\n\n&#x3C;!-- info: What are some discouraged use cases of a model trained to maximize the proposed metrics on this dataset? In particular, think about settings where decisions made by a model that performs reasonably well on the metric my still have strong negative consequences for user or members of the public. -->\n&#x3C;!-- scope: microscope -->\nA general issue with paraphrasing is that very small modifications in the surface form might produce valid paraphrases, which are however rather uninteresting. It is more valuable to produce paraphrases with clearly different surface realizations (e.g., measured using minimum edit distance).\n\n\n</code></pre>\n            </div>\n\n          </div>\n        </div>\n\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </section>\n\n</div>","title":"opusparcus","type":"Paraphrasing","languages":"German, English, Finnish, French, Russian, Swedish","summary":"Opusparcus is a paraphrase corpus for six European languages - German, English, Finnish, French, Russian, and Swedish.
