These words are especially relevant today, as powerful and flexible language models generate natural language and code that is increasingly human-like. However, these same systems challenge our trust, exhibiting odd degeneracies, amplifying biases, and producing flawed reasoning. In this talk, I will introduce two directions for harnessing the potential of these language models while mitigating the risks. First, I will discuss unlearning: removing undesirable behaviors by integrating feedback and learning. Second, I will discuss how integrating language models with trustworthy symbolic systems can open the door to tackling challenging mathematical reasoning tasks. Join me as we explore the path towards trusting untrustworthy language generators.</p>\n<p><strong>BIO</strong></p>\n<p>Sean Welleck is a Postdoctoral Scholar at the University of Washington and the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence, working with Yejin Choi. His research focuses on algorithms for natural language generation and machine reasoning, with the aim of minimizing the effort needed to trust the output of AI systems. He has developed unlearning, decoding, and evaluation algorithms for controllable neural language generation, and methods for integrating language models with symbolic systems, with a particular focus on mathematical reasoning. He received his Ph.D. from New York University, where he was advised by Kyunghyun Cho. Outside of his research activities, he hosts the Thesis Review Podcast and enjoys running long distances.</p>\n<h3 id=\"user-content-keynote-2---timo-schick\">Keynote 2 - Timo Schick</h3>\n<h4 id=\"user-content-instructable-and-collaborative-language-models\">Instructable and Collaborative Language Models</h4>\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p>\n<p>Textual content is often the output of a collaborative writing process — which includes writing text, making comments and changes, finding references, and asking others for help —, but today’s NLP models are only trained to generate the final output of this process. In this talk, we will discuss an alternative approach where models are trained to imitate the entire writing process. We will look at examples of how this enables models to plan and explain their actions, to correct their own mistakes, and to better collaborate with humans. We will also discuss how to make such models better at following human-written instructions.</p>\n<p><strong>BIO</strong></p>\n<p>Timo Schick is a research scientist at FAIR working on few-shot learning in NLP. Previously, he did his PhD at the Center for Information and Language Processing (CIS) in Munich and worked in industry as a data scientist for several years. Timo's current research focuses on instruction-based learning and teaching language models to collaborate with other entities.</p>\n<h3 id=\"user-content-keynote-3---emily-dinan\">Keynote 3 - Emily Dinan</h3>\n<h4 id=\"user-content-challenges-in-evaluating-safety-for-llms\">Challenges in evaluating safety for LLMs</h4>\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p>\n<p>While research on large language models (LLMs) continues to accelerate, much recent work has called attention to anticipated risks and harms from their use in society. We will discuss challenges in evaluating the relative safety of these models as well as current approaches for doing so. Finally, we will highlight avenues for future research into evaluating and mitigating these harms.</p>\n<p><strong>BIO</strong></p>\n<p>Emily Dinan is a Research Engineer at FAIR (Meta AI) in New York. Her research interests include conversational AI, natural language processing, and safety and responsibility in these fields. Recently she has focused on methods for preventing conversational agents from reproducing biased, toxic, or otherwise harmful language. Prior to joining FAIR, she received her master's degree in Mathematics from the University of Washington.</p>\n<h2 id=\"user-content-sessions-and-papers\">Sessions and Papers</h2>\n<h3 id=\"user-content-talk-session-1\">Talk Session 1</h3>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Title</th>\n<th>Authors</th>\n<th>Mode</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>DEMETR: Diagnosing Evaluation Metrics for Translation</td>\n<td>Marzena Karpinska, Nishant Raj, Katherine Thai, Yixiao Song, Ankita Gupta and Mohit Iyyer</td>\n<td>In Person</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>BOOKSUM: A Collection of Datasets for Long-form Narrative Summarization</td>\n<td>Wojciech Kryscinski, Nazneen Rajani, Divyansh Agarwal, Caiming Xiong and Dragomir Radev</td>\n<td>In Person</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>A Survey of Recent Error Annotation Schemes for Automatically Generated Text</td>\n<td>Rudali Huidrom and Anya Belz</td>\n<td>In Person</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Truncation Sampling as Language Model Desmoothing</td>\n<td>John Hewitt, Christopher Manning and Percy Liang</td>\n<td>In Person</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Error Analysis of ToTTo Table-to-Text Neural NLG Models</td>\n<td>Barkavi Sundararajan, Somayajulu Sripada and Ehud Reiter</td>\n<td>Virtual</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Towards Credible Human Evaluation of Open-Domain Dialog Systems Using Interactive Setup</td>\n<td>Sijia Liu, Patrick Lange, Behnam Hedayatnia, Alexandros Papangelis, Di Jin, Andrew Wirth, Yang Liu and Dilek Hakkani-Tur</td>\n<td>Virtual</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3 id=\"user-content-talk-session-2\">Talk Session 2</h3>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Title</th>\n<th>Authors</th>\n<th>Mode</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Improving abstractive summarization with energy-based re-ranking</td>\n<td>Diogo Pernes, Afonso Mendes and André F.
